# getting icons

1.  Get icons from this website: https://icon-sets.iconify.design/fluent/.
    Use fluent ui system icons, prefer outline icons.
2.  When you pick an icon, click it, make sure the color is "currentColor" so it inherits the color of whatever you put it in.
3.  Copy and paste the SVG it into a component (inside `/src/icons`). We have to do this so the "currentColor" works.
